Fully automated, complete testing, for every option
	This is annoying because it would involve changing the output scaling and
	testing many things with different setups. Maybe we can script it somehow?

DEADLOCK - gif play on monitor 1, turn on monitor 2, gif play on monitor 2, turn off monitor 2
	- doesn't always happen (seems to happen after I first turn on my pc)

DEADLOCK - gif play, we resize the monitor with wlr-randr -> freezzes
	- maybe related to the above
